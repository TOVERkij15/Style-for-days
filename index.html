<div class="wrapper">


<p> 1-2-3). There are three different interactions happening to the header. I applied a radial gradient to the background. I then put a transition set to linear and ease. The last change I made was adding another image that shows up when you hover over the gradient. </p>

<p> 4).The example shows what will happen when you hover over the box. The background color will change to another color over the course of two seconds using a linear transition.-------> </p>

<p> 5). Like the example listed above, the box will change background color using linear transition.  The difference is the border-radius changes the box into a circle. ------> </p>

<p class= "p3"> 6). By giving the box a box shadow, I was able to give it a slight 3-d effect.  There is also a slight border radius so the edges arent rough which leads to the next image.------> </p>

<p class="p4"> 7). This image is identical as the previous image but slightly different in it's  active function. Find out by "press me".---------> </p>


<p class= "p5"> 8). This one is obviously text spinning.  I used transform rotating and animation set on  keyframes.----></p>

<p class= "p6"> 9). Rather than use just text to rotate, the tire image was used.  The only changes are the degrees and size.---------></p>


<p> 10). In keeping with images, I created an image using the active state to swap the images. This is like hovering over a button but the cursor has to be pressed down to change the state of the image. Press bottom right----------></p>

<p class="p7"> 11). The example is using transition like before but added with a delay. Use the cursor and hover over the box.------> </p7>

<p> 12).Did you see how the cursor changed into a pointer? This is an example of one change you can do with your cursor when hovering over something.<p>

<p class= "scrollbar"> 13). While changing the cursor, I also went ahead and added a scroll bar using webkit-scrollbar. This included a track and thumb so you could go either direction.</p>

<p> 14). The puck to your right was done using keyframes just like the tire.  The difference is the only way it becomes active is by hovering over the image.  Rather than a constant state, it is permanent.-----------------></p>

<p class="slide"> 15). I used a slidein keyframe on the animation to make elements move across the page. Hover.</p>

<p class= "ball"> 16). I took the slidein animation and used a soccer ball that stops after 2 seconds.  This unlike the top text does not slide across the whole page. hover. </p>

<p> 17). I took the soccer ball and made the element increase and decrease by adding another keyframe. hover</p>
<p class= "slide3"> <img class= "soccer2" src="http://www.villagelife.com/files/2012/09/Soccer-Ball.jpg" width= "200" height="200"/> </p>

<p> 18).In this example, I simply took the stress-ball and made it move side to side using a keyframe set by width.</p>

<p class ="p19"> 19). Take that same stress-ball and click on it.  This is using the same keyframe but changing the width to height making it move up and down.</p>

<p> 20). As you can see the coffee pitcher tips over slightly. This was established by using keyframe transform and animation. It is set at infinite-spinning but with the degrees so low,  it will stop half way giving it the tip over effect. </p>

<p> 21). The shadow box on the right is slightly different than previous shadow boxes in that now when you hover, you can see a shadow behind the text as well.  this was done by adding another line-height and text-shadow.-----> </p>

<p class= "p21"> 22). The book on the right appears stretching.  To do this, I used a scale keyframe.</p>

<p class= "p20"> 23). This one was like taking everything so far from this page and using it on one image to make it spin.  Hover over the pink circle. </p>

<p class= "p22"> 24). You Are welcome! This element is different in it's visibility.</p>

<p class= "p23"> 25). I made the rainbow using four colors under keyframes color.</p>

<p class="p24"> 26). This is the same with an added webkit-transform translate to keep it moving side to side.</p>

<p class="p25"> 27). In this example the font becomes larger once clicked on using the active function.</p>

<p class="p26"> 28). If you hover over the cat picture, the image will become zoomed out.</p>

<p class="p27"> 29). Using the fading animation, the image once clicked on will fade away.</p>

<p class="p28"> 30). This example allows the user to hover over the "word" box and enlarge the font. This was achieved by changing the font size in webkit-keyframe.
