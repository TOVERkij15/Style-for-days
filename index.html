<p> 2).The example shows what will happen when you hover over the box. The background color will change to another color over the course of two seconds using a linear transition.-------> </p>

<p> 3). Like the example listed above, the box will change background color using linear transition.  The difference is the border-radius changes the box into a circle. ------> </p>

<p class= "p3"> 4). By giving the box a box shadow, I was able to give it a slight 3-d effect.  There is also a slight border radius so the edges arent rough which leads to the next image.------> </p>

<p class="p4"> 5). This image is identical as the previous image but slightly different in it's  active function. Find out by "press me".---------> </p>


<p class= "p5"> 6). This one is obviously text spinning.  I used transform rotating and animation set on  keyframes.----></p>

<p class= "p6"> 7). Rather than use just text to rotate, the tire image was used.  The only changes are the degrees and size.---------></p>


<p> 8). In keeping with images, I created an  image using the active state to swap the images. This like hovering over a button works but the cursor has to be pressed down to change the state of the image.----------></p>
